What makes a "good" iOS App?
The apps I enjoy the most have a clean design with intuitive controls; I, as a user, can focus on the content of the app 
without being distracted by the functionality.  My favorite app, Instagram, is a great example.  Its design allows me to 
focus on the pictures, exploring different users, and giving/viewing feedback with little to no thought as to how to do 
so.  In other words, the design makes using the app intuitive.

Personal Motivation
1) What are you most passionate about?  How might an app help?
- Reading
- Imagination
- Innocence
- Love
- Children's Entertainment
- Christmas

2) Where are there frustrations or pain points in your life?  How might an app help alleviate them?
- It would be nice to have a more customized entertainment experience based on my interests.
- It would be convenient to have a simple/intelligent tool to use for the fantasy football draft.

One way to get ideas for apps is to download Featured Apps on the app store.  One experienced developer said he downloads
almost all of them.  They allow you to tap into the creativity of the community and to discover things you would have never thought of.
